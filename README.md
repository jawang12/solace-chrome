# Solace
  
Solace is a mental wellness mobile app that utilizes IBM Watson's Personality/Emotional Insights API to help users observe their own mental and emotional processes over time. Each day, users are encouraged to share their thoughts and feelings with Solace by simply speaking to the app. Solace will then analyze the recordings and output a visual representation of the user's personality and emotional insights. Users will have the ability to track not only their most recent statistics but also be able to check their progress over time.

## Getting Started
  
Follow these steps to get the app or the backend running on your machine
  
  
  
### Prerequisites
  
This guide assumes that you have Node (and npm) and PostgreSQL installed for the backend. 
  
For the client-side you will need XCode installed. 
  
If you don't, you can get them here: 
  
https://nodejs.org
  
https://www.postgresql.org/
  
https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/
  
  
  
### Installing Backend
  
```
git clone https://github.com/jennyrchan/solace-admin
```
  
Make sure PostgreSQL is running and in the project directory run
  
```
npm install
```
  
to seed the database
  
```
npm run seed
```
  
then, to start the server run
  
```
npm start
```
  
and connect to localhost:1337
  
You can login with:  
  
Username: anuj@anuj.anuj  
PW: 123  
  
  
  
### Installing Client-Side
  
```
git clone https://github.com/jawang12/solace-react-native
```
  
The application is linked to the deployed server so you do not need a local server running.
  
In the project directory run:
  
```
npm install
```
  
then to link the react-native libraries
  
```
react-native link
```
  
then, to start the application
  
```
react-native run-ios
```
  
and the app should automatically load!
  
You can login to the application with:   
    
Username: anuj@anuj.anuj  
PW: 123  
     
Or you can create your own account and start recording!


### Installing Chrome Extension
  
```
git clone https://github.com/mobiuschang/solace-chrome
```
  
  
In the Chrome go to:
  
```
chrome://extensions/
```
  
Check developer mode and click load unpacked extensions.

Then select the project directory. 

The extension will automatically load!
  
  
## Running the tests
  
Our test suite features testing for the routing, database, API and frontend. 
  
On the backend we test Express, our database models and our Watson API behavior. 
  
On the frontend, we test our React-Native component and Redux store for expected behavior, and also test specific actions of our libraries and modules. 
  
All tests are run via
  
```
npm test
```
